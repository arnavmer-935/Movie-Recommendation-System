In this project, I have downloaded two datasets - movies.csv and credits.csv - from the TMDB website.
I uploaded these files to a Google colab notebook and processed these datasets to create a new dataset - movies_info.csv - and trained a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library.
Then I saved the new dataset and the ML model as .pkl files using the pickle module in Python.
Next, I uploaded these files to VS Code and created a webpage using streamlit.
I integrated the model's pickle file with the streamlit code, and saved the changes.
Then I ran the file using "streamlit run" function in the VS Code terminal.
